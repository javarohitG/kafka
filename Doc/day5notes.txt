Avro Format and Schema Registry:

Avro is a data serialization and exchage format very popular in the big data world.
It stores the schema and data together.
Schema is in json format and data is in binary format making it more compact and efficient.
The schema is registered in the schema registry so that the sender does not need to send the schema again.
Once the schema is registered in the schema registry , it is assigned an id.
Through this id, the producer and the consumer can access the schema later.

The schema registry runs at port 8081.
In kafa, when we send the data in avro format, we need not write our own serializer or deserializer.
When we send the avro format data, we need to send the data in the format of GenericRecord.



rest proxy:

Exposes restful webservices to interact with kafka.

rest proxy starts at port 8082.

Ksql:
Provides a sql based interface to interact with kafka.

Ksql supports formats like csv,json,avro and etc.
The default format is csv.


Control Center:
Provides a web based ui for monitoring and administering karfa.
It runs at port 9021.

http://localhost:9021-------------home page of control center.
